Accurate measurement of contact geometry is essential for robotic perception and manipulation, enabling object recognition, pose estimation, and precise in-hand control. Photometric stereo-based tactile sensors provide high-resolution contact surface information by estimating local gradients from a single RGB image captured under directional lighting. However, conventional reconstruction methods integrate these gradients uniformly, without accounting for their reliability â€“ making them susceptible to errors caused by imaging noise, occlusion-induced shadows, and reflectance ambiguities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an uncertainty-aware integration framework that models the uncertainty of each gradient estimate and incorporates it as a spatially varying weight during geometry reconstruction. Gradient uncertainty is derived from the empirical distribution of photometric mappings obtained through sensor calibration, and the integration is formulated to approximate a maximum likelihood estimate of the underlying surface. A lookup table-based implementation is developed to support inference of both gradient and weight from observed image intensities. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments using a custom-built tactile sensor. Compared to the conventional unweighted approach, our proposal significantly reduces global reconstruction error, suppresses integration artifacts, and improves the geometric consistency of the recovered contact surface.

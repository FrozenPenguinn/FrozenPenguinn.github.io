Hi, this is Yen Hang (Henry) Zhou, a Ph.D student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University. I am currently a member of AutoRobot Lab, supervised by Prof. Tiemin Li and Prof. Yao Jiang. Previously, I received B.Eng in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua in 2023. 

My research lies in autonomous systems and robotic perception, with a particular focus on vision-based tactile sensors and photometric stereo-based geometry measurements. I am currently working on enabling accurate and rapid contact geometry reconstruction through model-based and data-driven approaches.

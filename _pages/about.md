Hi, this is Yen Hang (Henry) Zhou, a Ph.D student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) (THU). I am currently a member of AutoRobot Lab, supervised by [Prof. Tiemin Li](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1272/1973.htm) and [Prof. Yao Jiang](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1272/2102.htm). Previously, I received B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering from THU in 2023. 

Research Interests
------
From a **practical perspective**, my research focuses on autonomous systems and robotic perception, with an emphasis on **vision-based tactile sensors** and **geometry measurement via photometric stereo and structured light**. I am currently developing model-based and data-driven methods to enable **accurate and efficient reconstruction of contact geometries**.

From a **philosophical perspective**, I am deeply interested in the **Symbol Grounding Problem** in Artificial Intelligence. I believe that **sensing and autonomous interaction** play a vital role in how intelligent agents build an understanding of the physical world. Direct sensory experience provides the raw interface with reality, which is then structured through knowledge extraction and representation to form **common sense understanding**. Ultimately, I see this process as essential to achieving **harmonious coexistence between artificial and natural intelligences**.
